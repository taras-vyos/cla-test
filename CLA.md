# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [Project Name] ("We" or "Us").

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to Us. To clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from you ("You" or "Your"), We must have a Contributor License Agreement on file that has been signed by each contributor. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Us and our users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

**Please read this agreement carefully before submitting your contribution.**

## 1. Definitions

**Contribution** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "Project").

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Project to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. You Represent That:

- Each Contribution you make is an original work and that you have the right to grant the licenses above.
- Your Contribution does not violate any third party's rights.
- You are legally entitled to grant this license. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you have received permission to make the Contribution on behalf of that employer or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contribution.

## 5. No Warranty

You provide your Contribution "as is", without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

## 6. Miscellaneous

This Agreement is governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction]. You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
